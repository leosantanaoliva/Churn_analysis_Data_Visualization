## Overview
This project explores customer churn in the telecommunications industry using data visualization techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and identifying patterns, we aim to uncover insights that can inform strategic decisions to reduce churn rates and enhance customer retention strategies.

## Steps

### 1. Data Extraction
- We obtained the Telco customer churn dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
- Utilized Python to extract the dataset via REST API from Kaggle.

### 2. Data Loading
- Stored the preprocessed data in a PostgreSQL database for easy access and management.

### 3. Data Transformation
- Conducted data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Performed feature engineering to extract relevant features and enhance the dataset's predictive power.
