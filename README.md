# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project explores customer churn in the telecommunications industry using data visualization techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and identifying patterns, we aim to uncover insights that can inform strategic decisions to reduce churn rates and enhance customer retention strategies.

## Steps

### 1. Data Extraction
- We obtained the Telco customer churn dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
- Utilized Python to extract the dataset via REST API from Kaggle.

### 2. Data Transformation
- Conducted data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Performed feature engineering to extract relevant features and enhance the dataset's predictive power.

### 3. Data Loading
- Stored the preprocessed data in a PostgreSQL database for easy access and management.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Utilized various statistical and visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.
- Explored relationships between different variables to identify potential predictors of churn.

### 5. Churn Analysis
- Implemented churn prediction models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks, to forecast customer churn.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 6. Data Visualization
- Created interactive visualizations using Power BI to communicate insights effectively.
- Visualized churn trends, customer segmentation, and predictive analytics results to facilitate decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- Python
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Requests, psycopg2
- PostgreSQL (for data storage)
- Power BI (for visualization and dashboard creation)
